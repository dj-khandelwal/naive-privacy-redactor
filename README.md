# naive-privacy-redactor

## An experiment to learn more about Information Organization, Privacy Standards, and HTML/JavaScript.

We looked at various ways to personally identify people based on their information that may be availble in text. 
These could be via primary/secondary classifiers, the details of which can be found here: https://github.com/dj-khandelwal/naive-privacy-redactor/blob/master/InfoClassStd.JPG

Developed a naive privacy redactor that will scan through the text submitted in the text box on the HTML file and give a 'privacy score' 
and highlight places where your PII could have been breached.
